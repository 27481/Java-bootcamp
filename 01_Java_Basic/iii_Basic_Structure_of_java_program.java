static keyword -> static keyword makes it possible for us to run 
                  these functions without creating an object of 
                  the class 
                  This is because the static members belongs to class
                  itself, rather than specific instances of the class

so if i disassociate any function from an object of a class
means it has nothing to do with the object of the class 
it can be used as independent function and at the same time 
reside inside the class
