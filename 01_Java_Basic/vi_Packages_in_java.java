/* 
 
1> Packages in Java are used to group related classes and provide a hierarchical organization of       classes within a project.

2> Packages help in organizing and managing large codebases by providing a way to namespace classes and avoid naming conflicts.

3> By using packages, you can logically group classes that are related to each other based on functionality, purpose, or module.

4> This promotes code organization, modularity, and reusability. It also helps in maintaining code readability and makes it easier to navigate and locate classes within a project.

5> Packages in Java follow a hierarchical naming convention, similar to directory structures. 
    For example, you could have a package structure like com.companyname.projectname.subpackage. This hierarchy allows you to organize classes based on their relationship and create a clear and understandable project structure.

6> By using packages, you can import and use classes from other packages within your program, providing better encapsulation and separation of concerns.
