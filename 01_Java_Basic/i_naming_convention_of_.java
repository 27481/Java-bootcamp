/*

!The rules for naming a Java file are as follows:

The file name must match the name of the public class defined in the file (excluding the .java extension).

The file name should start with a letter.

It can be followed by letters, digits, or underscores.

The file name should be in CamelCase, starting with an uppercase letter for each word (e.g., MyFirstProgram.java).

Special characters such as spaces, hyphens, and symbols are not allowed in the file name.

The file extension must be .java.

For example, 
if you have a public class named MyFirstProgram defined in your Java file, the file name should be MyFirstProgram.java.
